### Requirements
- A computer with a Unix-like terminal and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed;
creation of a free account might be required to Download Docker.
- Some knowledge of Unix-like terminals is recommended, including basic commands and text editors;
a good learning resource can be [The Unix Shell: Pawsey Edition](https://pawseysc.github.com/shell-hpc).
- To optionally test the scripts in Episode 5 (HPC porting),
access is required to a system where [Shifter](https://github.com/NERSC/shifter) is installed.

### Release notes
- Fixes and improvements are being commited to this repo
- The [7Sep18 release](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/releases/tag/7Sep18) has been used during the 
[Pawsey COMBINE Bioinformatics Symposium 2018](https://www.pawsey.org.au/bio-symposium) - 6-7 Sep 2018
