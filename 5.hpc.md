### From a regular computer/workstation to HPC
So far we have learnt how to use Docker to run containerised applications and workflows in any Linux/Mac/Windows machines.  
However, some features of Docker make it not suitable for running on HPC systems, so that specifically designed container engines are required. Here we will introduce the use of [Shifter](https://github.com/NERSC/shifter).

Some of the features described in this Episode are specific to the Shifter installation at Pawsey; these will be marked with a prepended double asterisk \*\*.

\*\* Shifter is installed in all [Pawsey](https://www.pawsey.org.au) HPC machines; [documentation](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Containers) is available.  
Shifter can be loaded in the shell environment by means of the module system:

     module load shifter

If you have access to an HPC system, you can clone the repository of this Workshop there, and then change to the directory relevant to this Episode:

    cd $MYGROUP   ### ** Pawsey Only
    git clone https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18.git
    cd bio-workshop-18/episode4_porting_to_HPC/

### Pulling an image
Let us see how to pull the images that we got through Docker in [Episode 1](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/1.containers.md) and [Episode 2](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/2.fastqc.md):
- Ubuntu from Docker Hub
- FastQC from QUAY Hub

Pulling from Docker hub with Shifter is essentially the same as with Docker:

    shifter pull ubuntu

\*\* On the other hand, pulling from QUAY Hub requires having an account on https://quay.io 
and providing the corresponding credentials at pull time:

    shifter pull --login quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.11.7--4

\*\* Forgetting to provide the `--login` flag will result in an execution failure and an error message.  
\*\* At the time of writing, all registries but Docker Hub require login credentials on Pawsey HPC systems.

### Running an image
Similar to [Episode 1](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/1.containers.md), let us run the Ubuntu image with Shifter.  
If we are on a Pawsey HPC machine, let us ensure we are in a directory under either `/group` or `/scratch` first, and then start the container:

    cd $MYGROUP/bio-workshop-18/episode4_porting_to_HPC
    
    shifter run ubuntu

This will result in something like:

    zeus-1:<SOME-PATH>$

We got an interactive session inside the Ubuntu container. Now let us inspect where we are and what files we can see:

    pwd ; ls

We get:

    <your-group-path>/bio-workshop-18/episode4_porting_to_HPC
    1.pull-ubuntu-shifter.sh      2.pull-fastqc-shifter.sh      3.run-ubuntu-shifter.sh       4.run-fastqc-shifter.sh       5.run-fastqc-shifter-slurm.sh

We are in the host current directory and we can see its actual content.
Now let us `exit` the container.

We can notice a few differences compared to running containers with Docker:
- Shifter automatically starts an interactive container session;
- \*\* by default, some relevant directories in the Pawsey HPC filesystems are already mounted in the Shifter containers; these include `/group`, `/scratch`, `/pawsey` and `/tmp`;
- \*\* if running from a visible host directory, by default Shifter sets it as the current directory;
- Shifter automatically removes containers after execution is terminated;
- \*\* You might get a warning like:

        groups: cannot find name for group ID 34676
  This indicates a mismatch between the host and container groups IDs, and can be safely ignored.

As a result of these features, the syntax to run containers with Shifter is shorter compared to the one required with Docker.

Now, let us try and run the FastQC container as in [Episode 2](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/2.fastqc.md):

    
    cp -p ../data_files/SRR6166481_sub_1.fastq.gz .
    
    shifter run quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.11.7--4 fastqc SRR6166481_sub_1.fastq.gz

Work done! Note the container exits at the end, as the `fastqc` exits at end of execution.

You might get extra warnings when running Shifter containers.  
It is always good practice to read them carefully; however, most of them point to issues with no practical impact on the application runtime.

### Running an image using a scheduler
We have just run the fastqc container from an HPC login node, as it was a tiny test job. 
However, this is not good practice. The proper way to run container jobs in HPC systems is throught the job scheduler.  
Shifter is able to work with schedulers. For instance, in the case of SLURM we need to prepend `srun` and its flags to any Shifter command, e.g.:

    srun --export=all shifter <..>

As an example, the script `5.run-fastqc-shifter-slurm.sh` in this Episode directory shows how to write a SLURM script to run the FastQC task we have discussed above:

```
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH --account=<your-pawsey-project>
#SBATCH --partition=workq
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --export=NONE
#SBATCH --job-name=fastqc

module load shifter

cp -p ../data_files/SRR6166481_sub_1.fastq.gz .

srun --export=all shifter run quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.11.7--4 fastqc SRR6166481_sub_1.fastq.gz
```

### Other Shifter commands
Shifter currently comes with a small sub-set of the commands available to Docker; yet these are enough to run containers in a HPC environment. 
- `shifter images` : list locally available images
- `shifter rmi <REPO NAME>` : remove local image with given repo name
- `shifter help` : output help info
- `shifter help <COMMAND>` : output command-specific help info


---
### Conclusion
Using Shifter to run containers on a HPC system is very similar to running Docker:
- `shifter pull` substitutes `docker pull`;
- `shifter run` substitutes `shifter run`;
- less flags are typically required when running a container with Shifter;
- \*\* on Pawsey systems, key directories for running simulations are automatically mounted inside Shifter containers.
