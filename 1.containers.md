### Getting ready
This workshop requires the use of a computer with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. 
It is assumed that all commands are executed in a Unix-like terminal.

All the materials for this workshop, including tutorials and scripts, are available on GitHub. Run the following command to get them in the current directory:

    git clone https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18.git

Scripts covering some of the examples in this Episode are in a subdirectory:

    cd bio-workshop-18/episode1_ubuntu_container/

### Terminology

An **image** is a set of files that contains the application and all its dependencies, run-time systems, libraries that are required to run, as well as fileystem.  You can move images around, upload them, download them etc.

A **container** is an instantiation of an image.  That is, it's a process started from an image.  You can run multiple containers from the same image, much like you might run the same application with different options or arguments.

An image is read-only; when we use `docker run`, it makes a copy of the image and starts a container from it (and in read-write mode).

---
### Pulling an image
Type:

    docker pull ubuntu

The command will require a couple of minutes to complete, the final output being similar to:

    Using default tag: latest
   	latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
   	124c757242f8: Pull complete 
   	2ebc019eb4e2: Pull complete 
   	dac0825f7ffb: Pull complete 
   	82b0bb65d1bf: Pull complete 
   	ef3b655c7f88: Pull complete 
   	Digest: sha256:72f832c6184b55569be1cd9043e4a80055d55873417ea792d989441f207dd2c7
   	Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest

What happpened?  
`pull` is the Docker command to download a container image from a Web *repository* to the local machine. 
This command is downloading the container image for Ubuntu Linux. 
The adopted syntax is abbreviated, as the full one would be:

    docker pull docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest

See [Episode 2](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/2.fastqc.md) for an example of using the complete syntax.

By default, images are searched in the Docker *registry*, `hub.docker.com`, so that `docker.io/` can be omitted. 
There are several Web registries for container images; the ones relevant to this workshop are:
- `docker.io` for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) : default one, has a lot of images;
- `quay.io` for [QUAY Hub](https://quay.io) : contains a large number of bioinformatic repositories, mostly from the [Biocontainers](https://github.com/BioContainers/containers) project.

`library` is where all official Linux distros can be found in Docker Hub; it can be omitted. 
However, in general, this is where the maintainer's account would be specified. For instance:
- `continuumio` contains **Conda** repositories;
- `rocker` has very good **R** distributions;
- `biocontainers` has thousands of bioinformatics packages.

Very often several versions or variants of the same package are available in the same repository in a registry. They can be selected using a *tag*; if no tag is specified, the default is `latest`.

In the output above there are multiple `Pull complete` messages; this is because a single image is made up of multiple *layers*. This relates to how container images are built, which will be discussed in [Episode 6](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/6.cellranger.md).

Note that once you have pulled an image in your local machine, you will be able to run it as many times as desired.

### Running a container
Type:

    docker run ubuntu

`run` starts an image by creating a container, i.e. an individual instance of an image.

No output was produced! What happened?  
Docker has run the container as a Unix command. Because no argument was specified, the container exited without doing anything.  

Let us try and execute some Unix commands:

    docker run --rm ubuntu echo "Hello world"

Output:

    Hello world

Now we can see the results of a command run from inside the container.

You can try and run the Ubuntu container specifying other typical Unix commands as an argument, e.g.:
- `date` : prints the date (is it the same than in your computer?)
- `whoami` : prints the user name (who are you in the container?)
- `uname -a` : prints the Operating System information. If you have a Mac or Windows, does this match your computer's OS?
- `vi` : a popular Unix text editor, except that .. there is no `vi` installed by default in the Ubuntu container image, so this command will return an error.

For instance, try the following. 
In your regular (host) shell, ensure that the Time Zone is set appropriately:

    sudo timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Perth

Then print the date and time:

	date

Now, repeat the `date` command from within the container:

    docker run --rm ubuntu date

Do the dates match?


---
### Running a container interactively
Let us type:

    docker run -it ubuntu bash

You will get something similar to:

    root@eb100c3140a2:/# 

We have just got an interactive shell session inside the Ubuntu container!  
You can try and run any Unix command from there. When you are done, run `exit` to get back to the host shell.

Here we have used a combination of two flags to get an interacive session:
- `-i` keeps the container standard input open;
- `-t` attaches a terminal to the container.

---

### Managing containers and images
As stated before, `docker run` creates a copy of a Docker image.  This copy is actually still present even after the command we run in the container is finished.  This means we have a cache of stopped containers, which we can see with the command **docker ps -a**

```
docker ps --all

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
48a2dca14407        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon off"   10 minutes ago      Exited (0) 4 minutes ago                          pensive_booth

```

We can clean these up with the **docker rm** command:

```
docker rm 48a2 1bf15
```
which deletes the containers with the unique IDs `48a2dca14407` `1bf15ca4ba89`.  Note that we only need to use a few characters of the ID.  We can also reference containers by their names:

```
docker rm mad_booth sad_keller
```

You can even use a one-line approach to remove all containers (don't worry, Docker won't let you delete currently running containers):

```
docker rm `docker ps -aq`
48a2dca14407
1bf15ca4ba89
97b1e86df1f1
```

Rather than constantly delete containers, it's handy to use an option, **--rm**, that prevents Docker from keeping a copy of the container around after it's finished:

```
docker run --rm ubuntu date
```

That container won't be present in our list from `docker ps -a`

Just like containers, Docker also provides tools for managing images:

```
docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              4ca3a192ff2a        22 hours ago        128.2 MB
nginx               latest              abf312888d13        2 days ago          181.5 MB
bskjerven/asreml    latest              98e78f921787        8 days ago          1.92GB
rocker/tidyverse    3.5.0               4fd6ffc96dc6        5 weeks ago         1.88GB
```

And we can delete images with **docker rmi**:

```
docker rmi ubuntu nginx

Just like with containers, Docker won't let you delete images that are currently being used by containers.

### Access to directories and files
What directories does a Docker container have access to by default?

    docker run --rm ubuntu pwd
	docker run --rm ubuntu ls

The first output tells us the container is in the root directory `/`, and the second lists its content. 
If you now try and `ls /` in the host shell, you will get a different content list. 
This suggests that by default the Docker container:
1. is not running in the current directory of the host shell (in this case it is running in `/`);
2. cannot see the contents of the host filesystem.

So how can we work with files that are external to the container?

Docker allows to *mount* host directories inside the container, by providing the host path and a mount name. Try the following syntax using the `-v` flag, to mount the host `/` folder:

    docker run --rm -v /:/external_root ubuntu ls /external_root

Here we are mounting the host `/` in the container directory `/external_root`. 
Output of the `ls` command demonstrates we are now able to see the host files.

Exposing the entire host file-system to the container is usually unnecessary, as well as risky. A better idea is just to mount the directory where the files required for processing inside the container are located. For instance:

    docker run --rm -v /path-to-data-files:/data ubuntu ls /data

In many occasions it is handy to run the container with the current directory set to the path where the data files are; this can be done with the `-w` flag:

    docker run --rm -v /path-to-data-files:/data -w /data ubuntu ls

Along this workshop, we will always be working with the datafiles located in the host current directory. It is then convenient to use a slightly modified syntax:

    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data -w /data ubuntu ls

This syntax can look long and confusing. If we are going to keep using the same docker flags all along the exercise, we can define them once and for all with an environment variable:

    run_flags="--rm -v $(pwd):/data -w /data"
	docker run $run_flags ubuntu ls

Now try and play with the host current directory. Open an interactive session with the current directory mounted in:

	docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data -w /data ubuntu bash

Inside the container try and create a file, then exit:

    echo "Sunny day in Perth!" >weather
	exit

Finally, from the host shell check that the container has actually created a file in the host current directory:

    cat weather

**Note:** You can have mulitple mounts in your `run` command line.  Also, if the directory you want to mount to in the container doesn't exist, then the volume mount option, `-v`, will create it:

```
docker run --rm ubuntu ls /data
ls: cannot access '/data': No such file or directory

docker run --rm -it -v data:/data ubuntu ls -d /data
/data
```
---

### Best practices

* use `--rm` unless you need a long-running container (e.g. a webserver)
* Standarise how you mount data into a container.  For example, if you always use the `-w` option and mount to `/data` in your container, it's easy to swap out external directories (e.g. `/scratch` or `/group`) and it helps make your container (and workflow) more portable.


### Other common Docker commands
- `docker help` : list of commands and options
- `docker <COMMAND> --help` : command-specific help
 - `docker build <..>` : build image from Dockerfile; see [Episode 6](https://github.com/PawseySC/bio-workshop-18/blob/master/6.cellranger.md)
 - `docker push <..>` : push a local image to remote repository
